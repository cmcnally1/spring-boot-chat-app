# Simple Web Chat App

This application was created to review topics learned from a Udacity course on Spring and Spring boot.

It is a simple chat application that allows users to:
- Sign up and create an account
- Log in using their credentials (Will block unknown credentials using Spring Security)
- Write a chat message on a chat page
- Log out of their account

The application supports multiple users by using MyBatis to interact with a SQL database
